Coding Standards
==========================================================================================

1. Identifiers
	1.1 meaningful variable names starting with a lowercase letter
	1.2 variable names written in camelCase
	1.3 descriptive method names written in camelCase
	1.4 use of constants in "define" statements in place of literal numbers
	1.5 all class names are to begin with "PX", which is short-hand for "Phylodex"
	1.6 class names are self-descriptive
	
2. Internal Documentation
	2.1 Header comments for most functions should not be required, as the method names are
       self-descriptive
	2.2 Inline comments within methods should be in point form to describe a set of steps
           or a procedure only when necessary
	2.3 The use of self-descriptive identifiers and constants should help to make the code
           self-documenting
	2.4 A header comment for each class file shall show the author, date of creation, and
           the name of the class
	2.5 Header comments for *.h files shall have a short description of what the class
           accomplishes
			
3. Source code style
	3.1 Blocks of code should be properly indented in a consistent manner to demonstrate
           the nesting of the blocks
	3.2 Empty lines should be used to separate method implementations, and sections of 
           code within method implementations that do specific tasks
	3.3 The use of empty lines shall be consistent, and shall never exceed more than two
           empty lines in a section
	3.4 Comments should be used sparringly
